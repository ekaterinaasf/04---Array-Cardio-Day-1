Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

> - We need to create 3 files for the site itself: for DOM, for styles and for script.
> - We need to create 2 other files describing the project: Readme.md and development-strategy.md.

## 1. User Story: Create index.html

> - We need a container where all photos should be located
> - We need 5 blocks describing as `<DIV>` elements inside the container
> - We need to create a separate branch `index` for index.html

## 2. User Story: Create styles.css

> - We need to create separate styles for html. body, container for 5 elements and foe each element depending on the state in which they are.
> - We need to create a separate branch `css` for style.css

## 3. User Story: Create script.js

> - We need to create listeners for two states of `<div>` panels and depending on it apply appropriate set of styles for this and for neighborhood elements.
> - We need to create a separate branch `script` for script.js

## 4. User Story: Create Readme.md

> - We need to create readme.md describing the structure of all files inside this project.

## 5. User Story: Create development-strategy.md

> - We need to create development-strategy.md describing the set of user stories in which we divided an entire project.
