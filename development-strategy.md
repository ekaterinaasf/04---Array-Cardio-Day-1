# Numbery or NaNy: development strategy

Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

> - What files do you need to create?
> - What are you putting in each file?

## 1. Data & Log

> - which files of code do you need to create/change?
> - what are you changing in each file?

## 2. Init

> - which files of code do you need to change?
> - what are you changing in them?

## 3. User Story: Set Active

**A user can select which list of strings to display on the screen**

> - which files of code do you need to change?
> - what are you changing in them?

## 4. User Story: Add String

**A user can add a string to the String Sorter. The string is properly sorted and the active list is re-rendered (if it was changed)**

> - which files of code do you need to change?
> - what are you changing in them?

## 5. User Story: Reset

**A user can set the state and DOM back to it's initial values**
